Chris and Little Little Layla went outside into the darkening yard.

"Annie!" yelled Chris.

"Annie! are you there?  Blackie?" yelled Little Little Layla.

They couldn't hear Annie, but thunder and lightning.  

"Blackie is a smart bear.  He'll get Annie back unless something is wrong, said Little Little Layla."

But after five minutes, they still hadn't come back.  So Chris and Little Little Layla started walking along Blackie's favorite trail.

As they walked, the rain started to come down harder.  The ground got muddier.  And it got darker.

"I think we should go back," said Chris.

Little Little Layla knew that Chris was right.  But they were almost to the place where the trail turned back around.  

"We're almost to the spot where Blackie and I turn around, so going forward is almost as fast as going back.  So we might as well see if we can see them."

They continued onward and the rain kept coming down harder and harder.  

Just as Little Little Layla and Chris were starting to be frightened, they heard a yell.

"What are you doing out in that rain?" asked Annie.

Little Little Layla was so glad to hear that voice.

"Where are you?" she asked.

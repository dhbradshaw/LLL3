Outside, Chris and Little Little Layla saw only forest.

"Annie!" yelled Chris.

"Annie! are you there?  Blackie!" yelled Little Little Layla.

They couldn't hear Annie, but they heard thunder and lightning.  They looked at each other.  

"Blackie is a smart bear," said Little Little Layla.  "He'll get Annie back unless something is wrong."

But after a few minutes, they still hadn't come back.  So Chris and Little Little Layla started walking along Blackie's favorite trail.

As they walked, the rain started to come down harder.  The ground got muddier.  And it got darker.

"I think we should go back," said Chris.

Little Little Layla thought that Chris might be right.  But they were almost to the place where the trail turned back around.  

"We're almost to the spot where Blackie and I turn around, so going forward is almost as fast as going back.  So we might as well see if we can find them."

They continued onward and the rain kept coming down harder and harder.  

Just as Little Little Layla and Chris were starting to be truly worried, they heard a yell.

They ran toward the voice.

"What did you say?" yelled Little Little Layla.

"I said" said Annie's voice, "What are you doing out in that rain?"

Little Little Layla smiled and Chris laughed.

"Where are you, Annie?" asked Little Little Layla.

"We're over here!" said Annie.  "And we found someone!"

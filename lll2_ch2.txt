The next odd thing was Little Little Layla's mother herself.  She had always been good at playing the piano.  But after the birth, she started challenging herself with harder and harder songs.  After a few months, Little Little Layla's dad heard her play.  He was amazed.

"I knew you could play the piano," he said, "but I didn't know you could play like this!"

Little Little Layla's mother smiled at him.  "I've been practicing!" she said.  

"Well, it's truly beautiful!" said Little Little Layla's father.  And he was right.

But it wasn't just the garden or the music.  It was also her sewing and cooking.  It was her decorating and dressing.  It was her looks.

"I don't understand it!" said Little Little Layla's father.  "It's like you are becoming more and more yourself.  And I love it."

"What do you mean, what is she like?" asked Chris.

"Oh, I don't know.  How old is she?  Is she nice?"

"She's about your age.  And yes, she's nice. And fun!"

"Does she look more like me or more like Annie?"

"She looks like both of you I guess.  She has light freckles like Annie.  And curly hair like you.  But I can't see her all the way.  That's why I can't seem to draw her quite right yet."

"What's her favorite dessert?"

"Rhubarb cobbler."

"Does she have a family?  What's it like?"

"I don't know.  I need to ask her about her family."

"What does she do for fun?"

"Well, she likes to tease me.  And talk with me.  We tell jokes together.  She's very good at math and can help me when I'm having trouble.  And sometimes she helps me feel better when I'm sad or hurt."

"Does she know who I am?" asked Little Little Layla.

"Yes, I've told her all about you.  And she told me how glad she was that you came to help me get better."

"Well, tell her that I'd like to meet her," said Little Little Layla.

"I will," said Chris.

As they were talking, Little Little Layla looked out the window.  It was looking very dark outside.

"I think a big storm is coming," she said.  "Maybe we should go check on Annie."

"Chris, that is a lot of paper that you're bringing me," said Little Little Layla.

"Well, I drew a lot of leaves!" answered Chris.  "Let me show you some of my drawings of your mint leaves."

Chris pulled out a page that looked like a little forest.  It had leaves of different sizes at different angles.  Little Little Layla looked more closely and noticed a little spot on one side of a leaf.  Then she saw that the same spot was on all the different leaves.

"Chris, are all of these drawings of the same leaf?"  

"Yes.  I was trying to get a good drawing of it.  I haven't quite figured it out yet."

"But the drawings are all good.  All of them!" said Little Little Layla.

Chris shook his head no.  "None of them are right.  Some of them get closer, but none of them are right.  I'm not sure yet what they are missing."

"How did you get the bumpy feel on these ones over here?" asked Little Little Layla.

"It's partly color.  But the pencil actually pushes the paper when I draw.  I try to use the changes that makes to make the leaves more real."

The whole time that Chris and Little Little Layla were talking, Annie stood there looking bored.  Finally she spoke.

"We'd better hurry up here," she said.  "There are probably hundreds of pages of drawings and you guys are still looking at the first piece of paper."

Little Little Layla could tell that Annie would never let her look at all Chris's huge collection of pictures.

"Annie, have you seen Blackie yet?" she asked.

"No!  I've missed him.  Where is he?"

"Well, I usually take a ride on him about this time of day to give him some exercise."

"Oh!" said Annie.  "Could I take him today?  I haven't had enough time with him this trip."

"That sounds like a great idea," said Little Little Layla.  Let's make sure that's alright with him."

Soon after that, Annie was out riding with Blackie and Chris was showing Little Little Layla leaf after leaf after leaf.  The art work was great to look at.  But Little Little Layla kept being distracted by one question.

"Chris, what is Rosie like?"

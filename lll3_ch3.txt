Spring sun brings life.  Little Little Layla's mother thought carefully about her little daughter as she grew.  She decided that Little Little Layla was like the spring sun.  Plants grew in the sun.  People grew around Little Little Layla.  

Actually, so did plants.  The peach and apple trees in their yard were now the tallest and healthiest that anyone had seen.  Their fruit was not the biggest.  But it was the tastiest.  The peaches were the peachiest.  The apples were the most apply.  Little Little Layla's mother thought that Little Little Layla might be the cause of all these things, but she wasn't sure.  So when Little Little Layla was two years old, her mother tried an experiment.

Mr. Love was struggling with one of his classes.  

"These boys and girls just aren't learning their Greek!" he said.  "I've been working with them for four months now, and if I asked them to write 'I love Greek,' not a single one would be able to do it."

"Are they having trouble concentrating and paying attention?" asked Little Little Layla's mother."

"Oh, yes!  Their eyes wander every time I ask them to study."

"Try bringing Little Little Layla with you to school!" said Layla's mother.

"You think I should bring a little girl to help them concentrate?" he asked.  "Don't you think they would all just want to play with her?"

"Well, yes, they probably would," she said.  "But I think that Little Little Layla helps me do a better job at everything that I do.  She might help the children as well."

The next day, Little Little Layla's father brought her to work.  

"It's Little Little Layla!" some of the children yelled as he came into the building.  All the children wanted to play with her, and he let them.  But then it was time for school to start.

"I'm glad to see that you love my little daughter.  Each person who can correctly write "I love Greek" can take some time to play with her.

Little Little Layla's father began trying many new ways of teaching his students.  They began to find Greek more fun and interesting and their learning got faster and faster.

Miss Love's experiment had worked.

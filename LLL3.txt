By now you may have heard of some of the odd things that happened in the little town of Greenwood, Oregon.  But if you are like most people, you don’t know that they all happened because of one little girl.  People call that girl Little Little Layla, and this book is about her.

Little Little Layla was born small and after that she stayed small.  When she was one year old and learning to walk, she was about the size of a new-born baby.  People would laugh as they saw her walking on her tiny baby feet.  Soon most of the people in Woodston knew that the little walking doll was named Layla. At first some of the adults called her “Little Layla.”  But children always called her “Little Little Layla,” and the name stuck.

The first odd thing that Little Little Layla’s mother noticed was that her garden was greener the year after Little Little Layla was born than it had ever been before. Her garden was greener, the flowers were brighter, and the fruit was juicier.

"I think I'm finally figuring out this garden!" she told her husband.

"It really is beautiful, this year!" he said,  "What's your secret?"

"Actually, I'm not sure," she answered.  "Maybe the secret was just trying and trying to make the garden beautiful until it worked."

"That sounds like a powerful secret," he answered.

He was right, of course.  If you keep on trying to do something, often you learn how to do it well.  So keeping on is indeed a powerful secret.  But it was only part of what made the garden grow so well.

Over the next few days, Little Little Layla and Annie took care of Chris while Annie and Chris's mother took care of all of them.  Little Little Layla made sure that Chris rested.  As Chris seemed more and more impatient with sitting still, Little Little Layla had to work harder and harder to keep him relaxed.  In the end, it was drawing that worked the best.

Chris turned out to have a wonderful drawing hand, and Little Little Layla told him what she liked about each of his drawings.  That only encouraged him more and he started attempting more and more challenging drawings.  Little Little Layla saw how calm Chris was as he drew and how much better he had gotten over the last few days while practicing.  Her work was mostly done.  

"I think he's almost better, Annie," she said.  "He just needs to keep drawing."

"Chris, if I give you one of each of the leaves in my bag, can you make a drawing of one?" she asked.  I'd like to make a book about what each one does and it would be so much better with careful pictures."

Chris was happy to draw the leaves.  He began to draw the first one in great detail.  The next morning, Little Little Layla's mother arrived and they all ate an early lunch together.  Chris was happy and healthy.  

After lunch, Little Little Layla said their goodbyes and walked back home with Blackie.

"How was it, Layla," her mother asked.  "Chris looked fine.  Do you think he'll be alright?"

"Oh, mom, it was great!  And Chris has gotten so much better.  Thank you so much for letting me come to help.  And thank you for the kit of leaves.  They helped Chris in more ways than one."

"I'm glad.  Your aunt and I talked, and planned some family fun for a couple of weeks from now.  So it won't be long before you see Annie and Chris again."

And so as they walked home Little Little Layla had one more reason to be happy.

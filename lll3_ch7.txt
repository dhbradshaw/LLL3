Over the next few days, Little Little Layla and Annie took care of Chris while Annie and Chris's mother took care of all of them.  Little Little Layla made sure that Chris rested.  As Chris seemed more and more impatient with sitting still, Little Little Layla had to work harder and harder to keep him relaxed.  In the end, it was drawing that worked the best.

Chris turned out to have a wonderful drawing hand, and Little Little Layla told him what she liked about his drawings.  That only encouraged him more and he started attempting more and more challenging drawings.  Little Little Layla saw how calm Chris was as he drew.  "I think he's almost better, Annie," she said.  "There's just one more thing to try."

"Chris, can you make a drawing of each of the leaves in my bag?" she asked.  I'd like to make a book about what each one does and it would be so much better with careful pictures."

Chris was happy to draw the leaves.  He drew them one by one in great detail.  It was amazing each time pencil brought a leaf to life on the paper.  He stayed relaxed and he at the food that they had for him.  And when he was done, Little Little Layla finally felt ready to return to her mother.

"These leaves are beautiful," said Little Little Layla.  Now I can finally go home.

All of them asked her to stay with them.

Annie and Blackie were under a huge pine tree that made a sort of house.  The house worked so well that Annie was still dry.  And so was the dirt that they stood on.


"Chris and Little Little Layla," said Annie, "meet Matt!"

Little Little Layla looked to where Annie was pointing and saw the thinnest boy she had ever seen.

"Hi Matt," she said.  "My name is Layla."

"And I'm Chris," said Chris.

Matt seemed shy, so Annie spoke for him.

"Matt invited me and Blackie into this tree when it looked like it was going to start raining."

"That was nice of you, Matt!" said Little Little Layla.

Matt smiled.

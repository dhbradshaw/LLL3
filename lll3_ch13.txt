Annie and Blackie were under a huge pine tree that made a sort of house.  The house worked so well that Annie was still dry.  And so was the dirt that they stood on.


"Chris and Little Little Layla," said Annie, "meet Matt!"

Little Little Layla looked to where Annie was pointing and saw the thinnest boy she had ever seen.

"Hi Matt," she said.  "My name is Layla."

"And I'm Chris," said Chris.

Matt seemed shy, so Annie spoke for him.

"Matt invited me and Blackie into this tree when it looked like it was going to start raining."

"That was nice of you, Matt!" said Little Little Layla.

Matt smiled.

Little Little Layla leaned over and whispered to Annie.  "Does he talk?"

Annie grinned and whispered loudly, "No.  He only speaks Russian!"

"I do not!" said Matt.

"Oh, I see you can talk," said Little Little Layla.  "Well, thank you for letting us into your hideout.  But how long have you been here, anyway?"

"About a month," said Matt.

"A month?  Out in the woods for a month?"

"It's better than the orphanage," said Matt.

"Are you from an orphange?" asked Chris.

"What do you think?" asked Matt.  "Yes.  But now I'm on my own.  And I'm doing just fine, thank you very much!"

Little Little Layla knew that Matt would need a place to live when the winter came.  But she didn't want to scare Matt off.  So she just said, "It's quite nice, the place that you have here."

"Thank you," said Matt.  "It's not too crowded and I like the sounds at night."

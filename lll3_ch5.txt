One summer day when Little Little Layla was five, she got a letter from her cousin Annie.

"Dear Little Little Layla,

Can you come visit us next week?  We so want to see you.  And papa is going to take us all to the circus.

Don't bother writing back, just come if you can.

Your cousin,

Annie"

"Can I go, mom?" asked Little Little Layla. 

"Well, I can't take you.  I have to watch after Lisa and Benjamin.  And your father won't be back until the end of next week, which will be to late."

"I know the way," said Little Little Layla.  "And I've already been almost that far by myself when I went to bring food to grandma.  And I can bring Blackie and he can help me."

"Well, you do know your way around quiet well.  If you bring Blackie, I guess you can go."

So the next day Little Little Layla and Blackie went down the road to Annie's home.

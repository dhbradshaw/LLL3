One summer day when Little Little Layla was seven, she got a letter from her cousin Annie.

"Dear Little Little Layla,

Can you come visit us?  We need to see you.  Chris is sick and I know that you can help him.

Don't bother writing back, just come if you can.

Your cousin,

Annie"

"Can I go, mom?" asked Little Little Layla after reading the letter to her mother. 

"I'm afraid I can't take you," said her mother.  "Mrs. Jacobs needs constant help right now and I have to watch after Lisa and Benjamin.  And your father won't be back until the end of next week."

Little Little Layla thought about that a little bit.  And then she grew brave.  "I can go without you."

"Alone?" her mother asked."

"Alone.  I mean, not alone!" said Little Little Layla.  Her mother looked at her with a funny face, but she continued.  "I know the way.  And I've already been almost that far by myself when I went to bring food to grandma.  And I can bring Blackie and he can help me."

Little Little Layla saw that as she mentioned Blackie, her mother's worried face relaxed.

"Blackie.  Good.  Tell me how to get there and let me make a sack meal.  Then, if you bring Blackie, you can go.

So the next morning Little Little Layla and Blackie went down the road to Annie's home.

Little Little Layla was excited to see Chris and Annie again.  She helped her mother make them places to sleep.  Together they made some fruit tarts and fruit leather and other treats to get ready for their arrival.  And, pretty soon, they arrived!

Little Little Layla heard them before they got to the turnoff to her home and she rushed out to meet them and give everyone hugs.  Blackie heard them and came too, and even licked Annie, who had made special friends with him during the last trip.

Annie and Chris looked happy and healthy.  So Little Little Layla was surprised when Annie told her that she was worried about him.

"He looks healthy to me!" she said.

"He's healthy!  I mean, I think he's all better from the fall.  But this drawing thing you started . . . he just keeps drawing and drawing all the time.  After he cuts the wood, he draws.  Before he goes to sleep, he draws.  When he's milking the cows, I think he's drawing in his mind.  He's just . . . "

"Oh!" said Little Little Layla.  "Do you think that he drew my leaf collection?"

"That's what I mean.  He drew it.  Then he drew all the leaves again.  Then he drew each leaf five more times, changing the lighting and the angles each time."

"Wow.  I'd like to see the drawings!" said Little Little Layla.

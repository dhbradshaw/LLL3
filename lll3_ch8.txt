Little Little Layla spent the next two days making a cosy spot for Chris and Annie to sleep.  When her mother told her that they weren't coming for another twelve days, she got permission to make some fruit tarts, pies, and other treats for when they would come.  She gathered nuts, berries and honey and got to use real flour and real sugar.  While she worked, the time passed almost quickly.  And then one day Little Little Layla heard them before they got to the turnoff to her home.  She rushed out to be the first to meet them and give everyone hugs.  But Blackie beat her!  He frisked and played and even licked Annie, who had made special friends with him during the last trip.

Annie and Chris looked happy and healthy.  So Little Little Layla was surprised when Annie told her that she was worried about him.

"He looks healthy to me!" she said.

"He's healthy!  I mean, I think he's all better from the fall.  But this drawing thing you started . . . he just keeps drawing and drawing all the time.  After he cuts the wood, he draws.  Before he goes to sleep, he draws.  When he's milking the cows, I think he's drawing in his mind.  He's just . . . "

"But that's great!" said Little Little Layla.  "Do you think that he drew my leaf collection?"

Annie gave her an annoyed look.  "Yes.  That's what I mean!  He drew your leaf collection.  Then he drew all the leaves again.  Then he drew each leaf five more times, changing the lighting and the angles each time.  He tried drawing them at different sizes.  He experimented with different colors."

"Wow.  I'd like to see the drawings!" said Little Little Layla.

"Layla, don't you hear me?  I think he's going crazy!  No one draws that much or works that hard."

"Is he happy?"

"Yes.  Happier than ever."

"Is he still doing his work and taking time for the people he loves?"

"He works faster than ever, so that he can get back to drawing.  And he does still take time for fun with us."

"Then what's wrong?" asked Little Little Layla.

"It's just not normal!" said Annie.  "But why am I telling you, miss girl-who-rides-a-bear?"

"I think it's great," said Little Little Layla.  And I'd love to see the pictures.

Annie was right.  After helping cleanup after lunch, Chris took out a paper and started drawing.  Later, while they all talked together, Chris was drawing.

"How many pictures have you drawn today Chris?" asked Little Little Layla.

"None," said Chris.

"None?" asked Little Little Layla, "Annie told me that you have been drawing a lot.  But this is the first drawing that you've made today?"

"Well, I've been working on one drawing a lot today, but I'm not finished."

"Do you mind if I look at it?" asked Little Little Layla.

"No.  Come look."

Little Little Layla came to look.  There she saw a beautiful picture of a girl riding on a bear.  It's me! And Blackie!

Annie was right.  After helping cleanup after lunch, Chris took out a paper and started drawing.  Later, while they all talked together, Chris was drawing.

"How many pictures have you finished today Chris?" asked Little Little Layla.

"None," said Chris.

"None?" asked Little Little Layla, "Annie told me that you have been drawing a lot.  What did you do in the carriage while you rode here?"  

"I drew," answered Chris.

"The whole way here?" asked Little Little Layla.

"Pretty much," answered Chris.

"But you didn't finish a single drawing?"

"Well, I've been working on a drawing, but I haven't finished it."

"Do you mind if I look at it?" asked Little Little Layla.

"No.  Come look."

Little Little Layla came to look.  As Little Little Layla got closer to the page, she became more and more surprised.  This drawing wasn't like the drawings that she had seen Chris make before.  It was still pencil, but it was rich and deep.  There were different shades and beautiful lines.  And there was a girl.

"Who is that girl?" asked Little Little Layla.

"That's Rosie."

"Who is Rosie?" asked Little Little Layla.  Rosie was beautiful.

"Rosie is his imaginary friend," said Annie.

Little Little Layla looked at Chris to see if that embarrassed him and said, "I used to have imaginary friends, too.  There was Sarah, and Matilda, and Ben.  Ben was strong and nice and the three of us used to all ride on his back when we were playing.

"What happened to them?" asked Chris.

Little Little Layla looked at him.  "I don't know.  We just stopped playing together as often."

"That's too bad," said Chris.  "It's always sad to lose a friend."

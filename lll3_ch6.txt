Little Little Layla rode on Blackie.  It wasn't because she was tired.  She loved to walk and run through the forest.  But Blackie always seemed so happy when she rode his back.

She felt Blackie's thick bear fur and his big thick body under her and was surprised at how quickly he had grown.  Together they crossed two streams and ate three forest meals before they finally got to Annie's house.  

When they got there, Annie took Little Little Layla straight in to see Chris.  Chris was laying down in a bed with his hair rumpled.  He didn't open his eyes when they came in, but Little Little Layla saw that his cheeks were flushed.

"He's been like this ever since he fell.  He was climbing that huge pine tree behind our house and a branch broke," whispered Annie.  

"Does his head hurt?" asked Little Little Layla.  

"Yes.  He keeps talking about it.  I think it makes it hard for him to sleep right."

As Little Little Layla grew older, she spent more and more time outside.  She especially loved to go to the woods and to the sea.

One summer day when Little Little Layla was 4 years old, she was picking blackberries in the woods by her home when she heard a cry.  Then she heard a second cry.  When she went to look, she saw a little baby bear.  It was stuck under the branches of a large tree.

"Hello little guy," she said.  "Are you alright?"

The bear cried again.  

"Where's your mama?" she asked as the bear continued to cry.  "That tree must have fallen on you, poor thing!" And then Little Little Layla saw the bear's mother stuck under the same tree. 

"Are you alright, mama bear?" she said.  

She waited.  "Mama bear?"

She waited.

"Poor baby bear!" she said.

Little Little Layla gathered a big pile of blackberries and put them by the baby bear.  He stopped crying and started eating.

She brought him some water to drink.

"I'll be back soon!" she said to the bear as it ate and drank.

Soon Little Little Layla came back through the forest with her mother following her.

"It's right hear, mama!" she said.

"The poor thing!  And the poor mama!" said Mrs. Love.

"Can you help me get the baby out of the tree?"  

"I think so.  You hold baby and I'll work on this tree."

Little Little Layla took her pretty little sister, and her mother gently moved the tree trunk.

"Come on out, little guy," said Little Little Layla.  She bent down with baby and held out her hand with some more blackberries.  "Come on!"

The bear crawled out from under the tree and ate the blackberries from Little Little Layla's hand.  Little Little Layla laughed as the tongue tickled her hand.

"I think I have a friend!" she said her mother.

"I think you do!" agreed her mother.

And that is how Little Little Layla met her best friend, Blackie.
